== Description ==

This is a WordPress plugin for adding Warmachine/Hordes Army Lists to your blog.  Armies are entered in an XML format, enclosed in a shortcode, and then rendered nicely on the blog.  The armies are added to a new table in the wp database and can be referenced by id only using shortcodes.

In addition, we've developed an XML schema for describing the army lists.

It's located here:  www.geeklythings.net/army.xsd

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above.  This may be of use for extremely complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

Titles are optional, naturally.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
